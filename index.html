      The Goonies is a 1985 American adventure–comedy film directed by Richard Donner.
      The screenplay was written by Chris Columbus from a story by executive producer Steven Spielberg.
      The film's premise features a band of pre-teens who live in the "Goon Docks" neighborhood of Astoria,
      Oregon attempting to save their homes from demolition, and in doing so, discover an old Spanish map
      that leads them on an adventure to unearth the long-lost fortune of One-Eyed Willie, a legendary 17th-century pirate.
